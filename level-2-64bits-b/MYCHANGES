1. We made changes in the following files:
	scanner.ll, parser.yy, parser.ih, procedure.cc, procedure.hh, ast.hh, ast.cc, parser.h.

2. In scanner.ll, following changes were made:
	a. Added token declarations for '=', 'BASIC BLOCK', '<', '>', '>=', '<=', '!=', '=='.
	b. Return type of all logical operations set to int.
	c. ID of the basic block was fetched from the "<bb id>" string and returned to Parser as 'BB_ID'.

3. In parser.yy, following changes were made:
	a. Added fuction calls in grammar declaration to execute -ast and -eval operations.
	b. Modified rules for 'basic_block', 'rel_expression'
	c. Added new tokens: BB_ID, NE, EQ, LT, LE, GT, GE.

4. In Parser.ih, following changes were made:
	a. Added a new function check_goto_validity to check if the block id encountered while evaluation or ast creation actuallu exists in the cfg.

5. In procedure.cc, the following changes were made:
	a. New functions get_start_basic_block (to get the first basic_block from the basic_block_list), get_next_bb(to get the basic_block which matches the current basic_block from the basic_block_list) and get_target_bb (to get the basic_block with a given id) were added.
	b. evaluate function was modified to to get the GOTO statements working.
	c. Corresponding declarations were made in the procedure.hh file.

6. In ast.cc and ast.hh, following modifications were made:
	a. New AST's for rel_expression, goto and if were implemented.
	b. Corresponding Constructors, evaluate functions and print functions were written in each new AST class.
